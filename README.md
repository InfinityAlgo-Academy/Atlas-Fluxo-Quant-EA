## 🔥 Key Technical Logic
The EA utilizes proprietary algorithms to detect high-probability institutional footprints and market structure shifts:

- **🏛️ Institutional Order Blocks (OB):** Identifies liquidity zones where big players are active.
- **📉 BOS (Break of Structure):** Detects valid trend reversals and continuations.
- **🔄 CHoCH (Change of Character):** Identifies fundamental shifts in supply and demand.
- **⚡ Fair Value Gaps (FVG):** Spots price imbalances for high-probability entries.
- **⚖️ EQH/EQL Detection:** Filters out "equal highs and lows" to avoid market manipulation zones.
